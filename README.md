## Installation

There are two installation methods that are available. Follow one of these, then log into your Moodle site as an administrator and visit the notifications page to complete the install.

### Git

If you do not have git installed, please see the below link. Please note, it is not necessary to set up the SSH Keys. This is only needed if you are going to create a repository of your own on github.com.

Once you have git installed, simply visit the Moodle /mod directory and clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/accredible/moodle-mod_accredible.git accredible

### Download the zip

1. Visit https://github.com/accredible/moodle-mod_accredible and download the zip. 
2. Extract the zip file's contents and **rename it 'accredible'**. You have to rename it for the plugin to work.
3. Place the folder in your /mod folder, inside your Moodle directory.

## Instructions

### API Key

Make sure you have your API key from Accredible. We should have shared it with you, but it's also on the API Management Console.

### Issue Certificates

Go to the course you want to issue certificates for and add an Accredible Certificates activity. Issuing a certificate is easy, and you can choose whether specific students receive a certificate or not.

Once you've issued the certificate, head over to Accredible to edit the appearance.

Contact us at support@accredible.com if you have issues.
